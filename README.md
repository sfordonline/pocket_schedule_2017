Strategy: A brief statement about the purpose and goals of the site.

Name of the site:  Stephen's 2017 NFL Pocket Schedule

Articulate the purpose and goals of the site (e.g. 1 to 2 sentences):

The purpose of the site will be to provide the weekly schedule of all NFL games for the 2017 season for all teams.  The goal of the site will be to provide NFL football fans quick and easy access to the schedule from a desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone from any location. This will be accomplished using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SwipeBox to easily deliver NFL schedule content in an organized format.

Define the audiences (primary and secondary) of the site and briefly describe them:

The primary user audience will include any football fan who wish to quickly access a weekly schedule from a smart phone or mobile device to determine scheduled game day and times.

A secondary audience may be any friend, classmate, or co-worker of the web site author who wish to follow and keep track of NFL football team schedules for 2017 from any device on the Internet.
